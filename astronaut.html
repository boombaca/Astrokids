                        <h2>Astronauts may be the most well-known space workers, but they hold few of the jobs. 

                            Studying the effects of gravity on the human body. Explaining discoveries about the solar system in understandable terms. Building the next generation of telescopes. These are just a few examples of jobs related to space exploration.
                            The logistics of space missions require a large team of workers with a variety of skills. “It takes the persistence and intelligence of designers, engineers, scientists, and storytellers to bring a project together,” says Nasreen Alkhateeb, a multimedia producer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). “The potential of what you’re good at, what you want to do, and what you already know may fit with a career in space.”Space missions require workers in many different occupations. Scientists, engineers, technicians, and media and communications workers often collaborate on projects. <br><br>
